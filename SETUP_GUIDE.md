2. Replace the rules with the rules from `README.md` (see Firestore Security Rules section)

6. Copy your **Test Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`) - **Keep this very secret!**
7. Don't share the secret key with anyone or put it in code

### Step 5: Deploy to Netlify

**What is Netlify?** It hosts your website for free.

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your Zeezy Pro repository
4. Netlify should auto-detect the settings
5. Before clicking "Deploy", click "Advanced" to add environment variables

**Add Environment Variables in Netlify:**

Click "New variable" for each of these:

**Firebase variables** (from Step 2):
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = (paste from Firebase)
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = (paste from Firebase)
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = (paste from Firebase)
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = (paste from Firebase)

```

**Paystack variables** (from Step 4):

PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY = sk_test_xxxxx (your test secret key)
```

6. Click "Deploy site"
7. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 6: Set Up Paystack Webhook

**What is a webhook?** It lets Paystack tell your app when payments succeed.

1. Note your Netlify site URL (e.g., `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`)
2. Go to Paystack Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys & Webhooks
3. Scroll to "Webhook URL"

9. Redeploy site: Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Deploy site

### Step 7: Create Your First Admin Account

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in your details (use your real phone number in Nigerian format)
4. Complete signup
5. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
6. Find the "users" collection
7. Find your user document (by email)
8. Edit the document
9. Change `role` from `customer` to `admin`
10. Save
11. Sign out and sign in again
12. You should now see an "Admin" link in the navigation

### Step 8: Add Sample Shops (Manual)

Since you don't have API integrations yet, manually add shops:

1. In Firebase Firestore, click "Start collection"
2. Collection ID: `shops`
3. Document ID: Auto-ID
4. Add fields:
   - `name` (string): "Shoprite"
   - `description` (string): "Fresh groceries and household items"
   - `category` (string): "Supermarket"
   - `isActive` (boolean): true
   - `image` (string): (optional - URL to shop logo)
5. Click "Save"
6. Repeat for other shops

### Step 9: Test the App

1. Visit your site
2. Sign up with a test email
3. Browse shops (you should see the ones you added)
4. Test the full flow (currently shops will be empty until you add products)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Add Products to Shops

For now, you'll need to manually add products in Firestore:

1. Create collection: `products`
2. For each product:
   - `shopId` (string): the shop document ID
   - `name` (string): product name
   - `price` (number): price in Naira
   - `unit` (string): "kg", "piece", "pack", etc.
   - `inStock` (boolean): true
   - `image` (string): optional image URL
   - `lastUpdated` (timestamp): current time

### Go Live with Paystack

When ready for real payments:

1. Complete Paystack business verification
2. Get your **Live** keys (pk_live_ and sk_live_)
3. Update environment variables in Netlify
4. Redeploy
